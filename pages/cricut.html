                <div class="section_div-sideBysideText">
                    <p>A Cricut is an electronic cutting machine that can cut all sorts of designs from materials like paper, vinyl, card stock, and iron-on transfers. Some Cricut machines can even cut leather and wood!</p>
                    <p>You can use the Cricut to cut just about anything you would typically cut with scissors or an X-acto knife. A Cricut can cut with much more precision and speed than would ever be achievable by hand!</p>
